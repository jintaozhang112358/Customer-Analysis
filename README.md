# End-to-End Customer Analysis on Azure Cloud 

This is an End-to-End customer analysis project that consists of the following steps:

- **ETL**: Extract raw data from data lake, perform transformation on Azure Databricks, and load transformed data into Databricks Delta Lake.
- **Insight Generation**: Further analysis on processed data using SQL.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize findings using Tableau.
