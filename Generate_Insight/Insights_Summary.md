### Understand Cluster
Customer segementation generated five clusters: Profit Drivers, High Potential, Medium Potential, Low Potential, and Loss Makers.

The following three clusters are particularly worth noting.
- Profit Drivers
  - highest profitable
  - second highest purchasing frequency
  - retention targets
- High Potential
  - highest purchasing frequency
  - best recency
  - second highest profit
   - great potential to become profit drivers
- Loss Makers
  - customers to get rid of

### Loss Diagnostics
- Returned orders don't appear to be loss-making.
- Promotion efforts are overall ineffective.
  - Correlation between the amount of discounts applied and profit is -0.22.
  - Loss Makers tend to use more discounts, which implies ineffective promotion efforts.
